					<span id="verse1">
					Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?<br>
					Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality<br>
					Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br>
					I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
					Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low<br>
					Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me<br></span>
					<br>
					<span id="verse2">
					Mama, just killed a man<br>
					Put a gun against his head<br>
					Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br><br>
					Mama, life had just begun<br>
					But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
					Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry<br>
					If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
					Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br>
					Too late, my time has come<br>
					Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time<br>
					Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
					Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
					Mama, ooh, I don't want to die<br>
					I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span id="super_rock_part">
					I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
					Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango<br>
					Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me<br><br>
					<span id="Galileo">(Galileo) Galileo,<br>
					(Galileo) Galileo, <br>
					Galileo figaro magnifico</span><br><br>
					(I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me)<br>
					He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
					Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
					Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
					Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
					(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
					(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
					(Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
					(Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
					(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
					(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go<br>
					Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span id="rock_ctd">
					So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
					So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
					Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!<br>
					Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!<br>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span id="finale">
					Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br>
					Nothing really matters<br>
					Nothing really matters to me<br>
					Any way the wind blows<br>
