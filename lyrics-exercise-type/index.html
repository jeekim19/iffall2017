		<h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
		<h2>Queen</h2>
		<br>
			<div><span class="verse1">
			Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?<br>
			Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality<br>
			Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br>
			I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
			Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low<br>
			Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me<br></span>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div><span class="verse2">
			Mama, just killed a man<br>
			Put a gun against his head<br>
			Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
			Mama, life had just begun<br>
			But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
			Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry<br>
			If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
			Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br></span>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div><span class="verse3">
			Too late, my time has come<br>
			Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time<br>
			Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
			Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
			Mama, ooh, I don't want to die<br>
			I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br></span>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div><span class="SilhouetteMan">
			I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
			Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango<br>
			Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me</span><br>
			<span class="super_rock_part">
			(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro magnifico<br>
			(I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me)<br>
			He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
			Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
			Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
			Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
			(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
			(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
			(Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
			(Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
			(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
			(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go<br>
			Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br></span>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div><span class="rock_ctd">
			So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
			So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
			Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!<br>
			Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!<br></span>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
			Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br>
			Nothing really matters<br>
			Nothing really matters to me<br>
			Any way the wind blows<br>
